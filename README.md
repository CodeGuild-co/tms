## Sharing Changes

When you're done making changes you'll want to have them included in the official website (not just your own). So first push your changes up to your fork:

    $ git add CHANGED_FILE CHANGED_FILE
    $ git commit -m 'DESCRIPTION_OF_CHANGES'
    $ git push origin master

If you don't know what the `git add` or `git commit` instructions are doing, ask around!

Now your fork will have the changes, let's make a pull request to the main repo to have them included in the main site. You'll need to open your fork on the GitHub website and click the "New Pull Request" button. Hopefully you'll see a green bit of text that says "Able to merge", if so, click the "Create pull request" button, provide a description of the work you've done and alick "Create pull request" again. If instead you see a red error message, you'll have to fix the problems it talks about before your work can be merged.
